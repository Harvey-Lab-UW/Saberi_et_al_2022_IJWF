Data accompanying the manuscript 'Do You CBI Do what I see? The relationship between the Composite Burn Index and quantitative field measures of  burn severity varies across gradients of forest structure' by Saberi,Agne, and Harvey published in International Journal of Wildland Fire. See the main text of the manuscript for complete descriptions of how data were collected, and greater specifics on values.

This file contains aggregated plot-level data necessary to the run the analyses. The following columns are included:

1. PlotID: unique plot Identifier where burned plots have the convention: FIRE## and unburned plots have the convention FIREUNB##
2. Prefire_LCC: mean prefire live canopy cover per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1
3. treeheight_mean: mean tree height per plot in meters
4. BA_HA: mean basal area per hectare per plot in meters squared per ha
5. QMD: mean quadratic mean diameter per plot in centimeters
6. stems_ha: mean stems per hectare per plot 
7. livecancov_loss: live canopy cover loss per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1
8. deadneedle: mean dead needle index values per plot between 1 and 7
9. deepchar_mean: mean deep char index value per plot between 0 and 2
10. prop_killedBA:  killed basal area per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1
11. prop_killedSTEM: killed stems per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1
12. prop_meanbolescorch: mean killed bole scorch per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1
13.prop_meancharht: mean char height per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1
14.prop_surfcharmean: mean surface char per plot as a proportion between 0 and 1
15. TotalPlotCBI_mean: mean total plot CBI value between 0 and 3
